Note on Size Calculation Logic:
- Regular Files  :  Their actual byte size is used.
- Directories    :  Have no meaningful 'content size' in bytes.
                    Their size is recorded as 'None' during scanning and
                    displayed as 'None bytes' in the report.
                    They are not included in total size sums.
- Symbolic Links :  The size recorded is the actual size of the symlink
                    entry itself (i.e., the byte length of the target
                    path string it contains), not the size of its target.
                    This size is a numerical value, displayed as 'XX bytes',
                    and included in total size sums where applicable.
- Broken symlinks : There are reported separately and do not have a size
                    associated for comparison.
